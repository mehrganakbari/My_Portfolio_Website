        <p>
          React.js and Vue.js are both popular JavaScript libraries for building
          user interfaces, but there are some differences between them:

      <div className="my-5">
        <p className="my-2 text-yellow-400">1. Architecture</p>
        <p>
          React uses a unidirectional data flow architecture, while Vue uses a
          bidirectional data flow architecture. This means that in React, data
          flows from the parent component to its children, while in Vue, data
          can flow in both directions between components.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className="my-5">
        <p className="my-2 text-yellow-400">2. Rendering</p>
        <p>
          React uses a virtual DOM, while Vue uses a real DOM. This means that
          React updates the virtual representation of the DOM and then updates
          the real DOM, while Vue directly updates the real DOM.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className="my-5">
        <p className="my-2 text-yellow-400">3. Templates</p>
        <p>
          Vue uses templates that are similar to HTML, while React uses JSX,
          which is a syntax extension that allows developers to write HTML-like
          code within JavaScript.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className="my-5">
        <p className="my-2 text-yellow-400">4. Learning curve</p>
        <p>
          Vue is generally considered to have a lower learning curve than React.
          Vue`s API is simpler and easier to understand, making it a good choice
          for developers who are new to building user interfaces.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className="my-5">
        <p className="my-2 text-yellow-400">5. Ecosystem</p>
        <p>
          React has a larger ecosystem than Vue, with more third-party libraries
          and tools available for developers. React is also widely used in
          industry, making it a good choice for developers who want to build
          applications with a larger community and support network.{" "}
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className="my-5">
        <p>
          Ultimately, the choice between React and Vue depends on the specific
          requirements of the project, the preferences of the development team,
          and the skillset of the developers involved.
